# Su Casa Mi Casa

A cooperative escape game, made for Global Game Jam 2019 at Georgia State University. The game revolves around a heist, where two players take the roles of a burglar and an operator. The burglar explores the house via a game application, built with Ren'Py, while the operator sits away from the burglar and reads hacked information to the burglar via a web page.


Download the Ren'Py game via the [releases page](https://github.com/biggestcookie/SuCasaMiCasa-game/releases) or the [Global Game Jam page](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/su-casa-mi-casa), and access the web page at https://casa-operator.glitch.me

## Building

### Requirements

[Ren'Py 7.1.3+](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html)

The [`renpy-game`](https://github.com/biggestcookie/SuCasaMiCasa-game/tree/master/renpy-game) folder can be transferred to your Ren'Py installation folder. Once moved you can follow the instructions to [build](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/build.html) or [open](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html#the-ren-py-launcher) the project.

The [`website`](https://github.com/biggestcookie/SuCasaMiCasa-game/tree/master/website) folder contains a static web page. The [`index.html`](https://github.com/biggestcookie/SuCasaMiCasa-game/blob/master/website/index.html) file in there can be opened in most modern web browsers.

## Game Premise

A big-time heist duo have been privately contacted by a well-renowned artist to break into his studio. If they can slip in and out of his room in 15 minutes undetected, they may freely walk away with any and all of his belongings. The catch? Only one of them is allowed inside the room!


Our burglar successfully infiltrates the studio. The other sits behind the scenes, stealing useful background information on the artist from the web and communicating with the burglar over voice communications. The burglar suddenly finds himself locked in the room, with only cryptic hints they can't make heads or tails of on their own. Can they successfully escape the room?
